<!--the text used on the front home page. text is about browns bay-->
  <p>Browns Bay is an Auckland suburb. It is one of the East Coast Bays suburbs,  and is well known for its shops and  beaches.
  </p>
  <p>Browns Bay is well known for its sizeable South African and  British communities. There is an annual African festival held there every March  as well as Afrikaans churches and community centres. Consequently, Browns Bay  is sometimes known as &quot;Little Bloemfontein&quot;.  For the British, there is Speaker's Corner, one of Auckland's iconic English  pubs, as well as Brampton's - a grocery store selling only British imported  wares. In the centre of the main shopping street (Clyde Road) is a small mall,  at the non-beach end of which is a small outdoor stage, which anyone may use -  given enough prior warning - and entertain the populace at any time of the  week. At the other end is a boardwalk which runs the full length of the beach.  The beach front has a skateboard park which is well used by the young  population, a play area and a Boules court, which is used every Sunday  afternoon. The Returned Services Association is represented by one of the  finest in New Zealand, in Bute Road, (off Clyde Road), with entertainment every  Friday and Saturday, and the bar and restaurant open most days.
